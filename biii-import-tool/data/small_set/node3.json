      "value": "DIPimage is a MATLAB toolbox for scientific image processing and analysis build on the DIPlib image library. It is a tool for teaching and research in image processing. Most operations are independent of dimensionality, and are defined for any data type that MATLAB can store. Many functions are available through a GUI, which makes them more accessible to novices. The interactive image display windows, to which images can be automatically displayed after each operation, provide great insight into the image data.DIPlib is a platform independent scientific image processing library written in C. It consists of a large number of functions for processing and analysing multi-dimensional image data. The library provides functions for performing transforms, filter operations, object generation, local structure analysis, object measurements and statistical analysis of images. Key design features include ample support for different data types (binary, integer, floating point, complex) and dimensionalities.",
