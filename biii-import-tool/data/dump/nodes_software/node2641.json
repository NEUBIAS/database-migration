Cytomine allows to break common practices in this domain where imaging datasets,\r\nquantification results, and associated knowledge are still often stored and analyzed within the restricted circle of a specific laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis software is e.g. being used by life scientists to help them better evaluate drug treatments or understand biological processes directly from whole-slide tissue images, by pathologists to share and ease their diagnosis, and by teachers and students for pathology training purposes.","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":"Rapha\u00ebl Mar\u00e9e, Lo\u00efc Rollus, Benjamin St\u00e9vens, Renaud Hoyoux, Gilles Louppe, R\u00e9my Vandaele, Jean-Michel Begon, Philipp Kainz, Pierre Geurts and Louis Wehenkel"}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw013"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"Apache2"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.cytomine.be/","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[{"target_id":"3591"},{"target_id":"3592"}],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3570"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"32"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[{"target_id":"3561"}],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
