Its workflows provide an interactive experience to give the user immediate feedback on the quality of the results yielded by her chosen parameters and/or labelings.  The most commonly used workflow is pixel classification, which requires very little parameter tuning and instead offers a machine learning technique for segmenting an image based on local image features computed for each pixel.\r\n\r\nOther workflows include:\r\n\r\nObject classification: Similar to pixel classification, but classifies previously segmented objects instead of making pixel-wise decisions\r\nCarving: Semi-automated segmentation of 3D objects (e.g. neurons) based on user-provided seeds\r\nManual Tracking: Semi-automated cell tracking of 2D+time or 3D+time images based on manual annotations\r\nAutomated tracking: Fully-automated cell tracking of 2D+time or 3D+time images with some parameter tuning\r\nDensity Counting: Learned cell population counting based on interactively provided user annotation\r\n\r\n\r\nStrengths: interactive, simple interface (for non-experts), few parameters, larger-than-RAM data, multi-dimensional data (time, 3D space, channel), headless operation, batch mode, parallelized computation, open source\r\nWeaknesses: Pre-built workflows (not reconfigurable), no plugin system, visualization sometimes buggy, must import 3D data to HDF5, tracking requires an external CPLEX installation\r\n\r\nSupported Formats: hdf5, tiff, jpeg, png, bmp, pnm, gif, hdr, exr, sif","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":null}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872394"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"GPLv2"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.ilastik.org/","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[{"target_id":"3592"}],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3575"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"31"},{"target_id":"32"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
