Both optical sectioning and super-resolution applications are supported. The software is also capable of maximum a posteriori probability image estimation (MAP-SIM), an alternative method for reconstruction of structured illumination images. MAP-SIM can potentially reduce reconstruction artifacts, which commonly occur due to refractive index mismatch within the sample and to imperfections in the illumination.\r\n\r\n2665","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":"Pavel K?\u00ed\u009eek, Tom\u00e1\u009a Luke\u009a, Martin Ovesn\u00fd, Karel Fliegel, and Guy M.
