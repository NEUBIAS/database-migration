Icy is an open source bioimaging software package that aims to provide a framework for authors to share, and others to reproduce, research once the sample hits the microscope.  Icy was released in April 2011 and is being developed at the Quantitative Image Analysis Unit at the Pasteur Institute in France by Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin and his team.  The goal is to provide standardized software architecture, with a visual programming framework and online repository of plugins and protocols, brought together with sophisticated content-management and communication systems for such extended reproducible research.\r\nIcy provides intuitive user interfaces for graphical protocol development for image acquisition, analysis and storage that are easy to use for biologists and developers alike.  Developers should find that Icy\u0092s \u0091EzPlug\u0092 API library, versioning, and auditing tools make creating a custom plugin from most any source easy.  Users will find the automatic error reporting, central repository and on-line community hub great for storing and sharing plugins and protocols.  Icy is even developing a cloud-computing framework to address the scalability issues of high-content screening.\r\nAs of this writing there are 207 plug-ins 50 scripts and 14 protocols available for download, including those for microscope control, particle tracking, three dimensional segmentation, and even spot detection using wavelets.\r\nPublished in Nature Methods (Nat Methods 9(7):690-6 (2012)).\r\nIcy can be downloaded at http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/\r\nStrength:\r\n\r\nOpen-source.\r\nCentralized repository of 205 plugins, 50 scripts and 14 protocols\r\nRate and comment plugins\r\n5D\r\nSearch and install features directly from Icy\r\nGraphical programming with protocols\r\nWrite scripts in javascript or python\r\nAutomatic bug reports\r\nNative ImageJ integration 100% compatible\r\nNative Micro-Manager integration\r\nShare your plugins and protocols online\r\nCan run headless\r\nIntuitive user interface\r\nOnline management of plugins\r\nConnect Icy to Matlab\r\nInteractive widgets\r\nBuild your graphical interface with EzPlug\r\nUse the power of your graphic card with OpenCL\r\nLoaded with 20 up-to date libs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n\r\nNo tutorial for plugins writing..yet\r\nSee here:\r\nhttp://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/index.php?display=devDoc\r\nhttp://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/index.php?display=detailTag&tagId=29\r\nand here:\r\nhttp://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/index.php?display=startDevWithIcy\r\nand also here:\r\nhttp://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/index.php?display=startDevWithIcy\r\n\r\nImage size limited to 2GigaByte per single  2D channel (means that an image of 40.000x40.000 can be handle by Icy.
