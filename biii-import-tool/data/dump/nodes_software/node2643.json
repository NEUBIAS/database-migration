This task often involves complex image processing adapted to the specific topology and quality of the image to be analyzed.\n\nSR-Tesseler 2661 is an open-source segmentation software using Vorono\u00ef tessellation constructed from the coordinates of localized molecules. It allows precise, robust and automatic quantification of protein organization at different scales, from the cellular level down to clusters of a few fluorescent markers.\n\nSR-Tesseler is insensitive to cell shape, molecular organization, background and noise, allowing comparing efficiently different biological conditions in a non-biased manner, and perform quantifications on various proteins and cell types.\n\nSR-Tesseler software comes with a very simple and intuitive graphical user interface, providing direct visual feedback of the results and is freely available under GPLv3 license.","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":"Florian Levet, Jean-Baptiste Sibarita"}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"10.1038/nmeth.3579"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"GPLv3"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.iins.u-bordeaux.fr/team-sibarita-SR-Tesseler","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[{"target_id":"3593"}],"field_has_reference_publication":[{"uri":"10.1038/nmeth.3579","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3575"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"31"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
