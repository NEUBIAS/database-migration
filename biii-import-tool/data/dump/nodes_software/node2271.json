Main features: algorithms for cell segmentation, cell tracing, cell tracking, and vessel tracing. Registration and mosaicing algorithms for large scale datasets. Visualization tools actively linked to inspect and edit results.\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Open-source, free, multi platform, code is highly parallelized, uses git for version control\r\n- Large scale processing, also efficient visualization of such datasets.\r\n- Active learning module for classification\r\n- Most of the algorithms have been extended to handle 16-bit images, and 3D Images.\r\n- Possibility to create complex pipelines thanks to it\u0092s modular architecture\r\n- Editing tools are designed to save the editing operation which can later be used to validate the algorithms performance\r\n- Advance preprocessing algorithms like curvelets, tensor voting, and wrappers around ITK-algorithms\r\n- Multiple viewers included to inspect results such as: Histograms, scatter plots, tables, kymograph, all of them linked together.\r\n- Strong emphasis to work on multichannel images (up to 40 channels)\r\n- Rich number of cell features included \r\nWeakness:\r\n- GUI is suboptimal compared to commercial packages.\r\n- Tracking module requires an external library CPLEX.\r\n- No support for brightfield images\r\n- No native interoperability with other software packages\r\n- More documentation needed / tutorial needed\r\n","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":null}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"doi:10.1007/s12021-011-9115-0"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"GPLv2, and Apache 2.0"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[{"target_id":"3593"}],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3575"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"31"},{"target_id":"32"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
