It is client-server based system which supports 5D images, including  big images and high-content screening data.  Data are stored on a server using relational database. They are accessed using 3 main clients, a desktop client, a web client and a command line tool. There are bindings from OMERO to other image analysis packages, like FLIMfit, OMERO.searcher.  The data in OMERO are organized in groups. A user can be a member of one or more groups. This groups can be collaborative or private, there are 4 levels of permissions to access/edit/annotate/delete the data of other users.\r\n\r\nThe package is supported not only by community forums, but also by a dedicated team which helps users to solve their problems and deals with the bugs submitted via error submission system.\r\n\r\n**Strengths:** Open source, scalable software, Supports diverse sets of imaging applications and domains (EM,LM, HCS, DigPath)\r\nCross-platform, Java-based application, API support for Java, Python, C++, Django, On-line Forums, Automatic QA and upload of software errors\r\nMulti-dimensional images, Web access, Free Demo-server accounts\r\n\r\n**Limitations:** Enterprise-scale software, so complex install, requires expertise, Actively developing API, Python scripts and functions still developing\r\n","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":"OME Consortium; http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/about/who-ome"}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1896"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"GPL v2"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.openmicroscopy.org/","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[{"target_id":"3591"},{"target_id":"3593"},{"target_id":"3592"}],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3575"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"31"},{"target_id":"32"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
