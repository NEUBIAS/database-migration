It provides a user-friendly interface and a powerful suite of detection, analysis and data presentation tools. It works with individual phase or fluorescence images as well as stacks, hyperstacks, and folders of any of these types. Even large image sets are analyzed rapidly generating raw tabular data that can either be saved or copied as is, or have additional statistical analysis performed and graphically represented directly from within MicrobeJ, making it an all-in-one image analysis solution.","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":"Adrien Ducret, Yves Brun, Ellen Quardokus"}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.77"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"unknown"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.indiana.edu/~microbej/index.html","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[{"target_id":"3591"}],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3570"}],"field_platform":[],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
