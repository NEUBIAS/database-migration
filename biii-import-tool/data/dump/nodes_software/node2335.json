XuvTools runs on Microsoft Windows XP and Vista, Linux and Apple Mac computers. It supports 32 and 64bit operating systems (with 64bit highly preferred). XuvTools is free and open source software (see Licensing), so you can start using it immediately. Go to Downloads and give it a try.\r\n\r\nThe goal of XuvTools is to provide tools, that combine multiple microscopic recordings to obtain a larger field of view (\u0093stitching\u0094) and a higher dynamic range (\u0093HDR\u0094 recombination), or better resolution (multi view reconstruction), and to make these tools publicly available.","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":null}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"GNU General Public License v2"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.xuvtools.org","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3575"}],"field_platform":[],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
