This ranges from image access (read / write), common filters (convolution, morphology, order based, Wiener, feature extraction, image enhancement, ...), image transformation (rotation, affine transformation, ...) to segmentation algorithms (thresholding, watershed, region growing). There is also an extensive list of functions to deal with binary or label mask and perform for instance connected particle analysis or morphological operations.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Most functions extend to nD\r\n- optimized functions (muti-threaded for some)\r\n- Matlab community (Matlab central)\r\n- relatively low entry-threshold for functionality\r\n- Tutorials & Webinars\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n- no embedded visualization of nD Microscopy data\r\n","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":null}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"commercial"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://www.mathworks.com/products/image/index.html","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3577"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"31"},{"target_id":"32"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
