It provides image filtering and morphological processing as well as feature computation (both image-level features such as Haralick texture features and SURF local features). These can be used with other Python-based libraries for machine learning to build a complete analysis pipeline.\r\n\r\nMahotas is appropriate for users comfortable with programming or builders of end-user tools.\r\n\r\n==== Strengths\r\n\r\nThe major strengths are in speed and quality of documentation. Almost all of the functionality is implemented in for multiple dimensions. It can be used with other Python packages which provide additional functionality.\r\n\r\nMahotas and all packages on which it relies are open-source.\r\n\r\n==== Considerations\r\n\r\nA complete environment will require installing multiple packages.","format":"basic_html","summary":""}],"field_attribution_instructions":[],"field_free_tagging":[],"field_has_author":[{"value":"Luis Pedro Coelho"}],"field_has_biological_terms":[],"field_has_comparison":[],"field_has_documentation":[],"field_has_doi":[{"value":"10.5334/jors.ac"}],"field_has_entry_curator":[{"target_id":"80"}],"field_has_function":[],"field_has_interaction_level":[{"target_id":"3574"}],"field_has_license":[{"value":"MIT"}],"field_has_location":[{"uri":"http://mahotas.rtfd.org/","title":"","options":[]}],"field_has_programming_language":[],"field_has_reference_publication":[],"field_has_topic":[],"field_has_usage_example":[],"field_image":[],"field_is_compatible_with":[],"field_is_covered_by_training_mat":[],"field_is_dependent_of":[],"field_license_openness":[{"target_id":"3570"}],"field_platform":[{"target_id":"31"},{"target_id":"32"},{"target_id":"29"}],"field_supported_image_dimension":[],"field_type":[{"target_id":"3567"}]}
